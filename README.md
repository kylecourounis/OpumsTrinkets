# OpumsTrinkets
OpumsTrinkets is a mod for Minecraft version 1.12.2 that I worked on back in early 2019. It was purely for my own edification. I had improved my Java skills since I had last seriously worked on mods (2016-17ish) and I wanted to see what I could do with my new abilities.

A lot of the items, blocks, and config options you'll see in this mod were purely for learing/testing things. As evidenced by the lack of commits, I did not spend much time on it. So, even if you do try and build the mod, not everything works perfectly.

My old username on many platforms (including Minecraft) was "opum2", hence why this mod is titled OpumsTrinkets. 

#### If you would like to see a newer mod of mine, the source code for Ability Rings (which was made for Minecraft 1.17.x & 1.18.x) can be found [here](https://github.com/kylecourounis/AbilityRings).
